<h4><strong>Event Description</strong></h4>

<p><strong>Lost in the black space filled with planets with no aliens but AVL trees. Where stars are aligned in complex graphs and Milky Way is no less than a matrix catching what it sees.
Fasten the seatbelts of your jet and ignite the key of algorithms. Ride across the AVL trees as balancing is what they need. Track down the boiling stars like Kruskal would do. Escape the Milky Way, dynamic programming will always be there for you.<br />
But remember to turn the optimization button &lsquo;on&rsquo; throughout your algorithmic space adventure.</strong></p>

<h4><strong>Rules</strong></h4>


<ul>
    <li>&nbsp; In case of tie, team with more 3 marker correct questions will be the winner. If it&#39;s also same, then the one with more 2 marker correct questions will be chosen. At last if all things are same coin will be tossed. Rules and regulations:</li>

	<li>The MCQ paper will be based on algorithms and its analysis.</li>
	<li>Problems lying in story may or may not be well known algorithms.</li>
	<li>It is a team based event. Each team can have a maximum of 2 members. Lone wolves are also welcome.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;Use of Internet, pen-drives or any sort of helping material is strictly.</li>

	<li>&nbsp;The decision of the organizers shall be final and binding. Organizers have the right to disqualify any team if they break any rules.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;The evaluation of subjective question will be done on the basis of feasibility, optimality, running time complexity and space complexity of the solutions.</li>
