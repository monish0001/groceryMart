<h4><strong>Event Description</strong></h4>

<p><strong>The silicon microchips themselves might be cheap , but the whole dark boxes &nbsp;are not . </strong></p>

<p><strong>Take off any metal object on your arms or fingers, or else you may fall prey to the charges while messing up with wires and if messing with those tangled wires doesn&rsquo;t freak you and is a game of your realm, then try beating the best, in speed and in brains.</strong></p>

<p><strong>You need good brains and an eagle&rsquo;s eye &nbsp;because when you jump into the dark box one screw can put your life at &nbsp;stake. You surely get awarded for right moves, but hell, you pay for your wrong moves.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
