<p>About the Product</p>

<ul>
	<li>A popular sweet-tasting root vegetable, Carrots are narrow and cone shaped.</li>
	<li>They have thick, fleshy, deeply colored root, which grows underground, and feathery green leaves that emerge above the ground.</li>
	<li>While these greens are fresh tasting and slightly bitter, the carrot roots are crunchy textured with a sweet and minty aromatic taste.</li>
	<li>Fresho brings you the flavour and richness of the finest crispy and juicy carrots that are locally grown and the best of the region.</li>
</ul>

<p>Benefits</p>

<ul>
	<li>Carrots provide the highest content of vitamin A of all the vegetables.</li>
	<li>Brightly orange colored carrots have pigments like carotenoids and flavonoids, that provide several antioxidants and act as a defense against cancer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Storage and Uses</p>

<ul>
	<li>Refrigerate carrots in a mesh bag. Alternatively to retain freshness and for more longevity, trim off the greens and put whole carrots in a container of water and refrigerate. With this method, they stay nice and crunchy.</li>
	<li>If the water starts to look cloudy, change it with fresh water. Stored this way, carrots can last for even a month with no ill effects and do not wilt easily.</li>
	<li>Carrots have a mild, pleasant flavour that is great by themselves or blended with other foods.</li>
	<li>They are even good for stuffings and in making sauces.</li>
	<li>Carrot juice is said to be one of the most healthiest drink. Carrot halwa is the most popular Indian sweet made out of this vegetable.</li>
	<li>Do look up carrot jam as well.</li>
</ul>
