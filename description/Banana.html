<p>About the Product</p>

<ul>
	<li>Tiny and small sized, this variety is called Yelakki in Bangalore and Elaichi in Mumbai. Despite its small size, they are naturally flavoured, aromatic and sweeter compared to regular bananas.</li>
	<li>Yelakki bananas are around 3- 4 inches long and contain a thinner skin and better shelf life than Robusta bananas.</li>
</ul>

<p>Benefits</p>

<ul>
	<li>One banana supplies 30 percent of the daily vitamin B6 requirement and is rich in vitamin C, potassium and fiber.</li>
	<li>It reduces appetite and promotes weight loss, while also boosting the immune system and keeping the bones strong.</li>
	<li>It is very good for pregnant women and athletes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Storage and Uses</p>

<ul>
	<li>Store them in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Fresh, raw yelakkis are green. They turn into golden yellow on ripening. Look for brown speckles and yellow skin to identify ripened ones.</li>
	<li>Slice them onto pancakes, blend into smoothies or add to fruit salads. Heat brings out the bananas&#39; creamy sweetness. Try baking or sauteing them with butter and sugar for a delicious dessert.</li>
